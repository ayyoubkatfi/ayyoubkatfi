ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Ayyoub Katfi, an infinite thinker and a software developer who has passion for creating working solutions while ensuring their effectiveness and scalability. I have experience with Problem solving and C/C++, JavaScript/React, pyhton/Django and Php/Laravel, hence I enjoy simplifying complex things by writing elegant codes.

It does not matter whether it is website construction, participating in open source projects or attending any new technologies, I am keen on doing it and making sharing the knowledge.

ðŸŒŸ If you look on my GitHub, you can see some of my works and experiments, and some of my contributions to the work of developers. I welcome any kind of work so do not be embarrassed about contacting me.

ðŸš€ I look forward to working with you in future in order to make sure that we are able to do great things together.
