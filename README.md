Hey, Iâ€™m Ayyoub Katfi, a software developer and a 1337 student, always fascinated by making scalable web applications and backend systems.

ðŸ’¡ I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, maintainable code-from designing robust APIs down to crafting seamless user experiences.

Iâ€™m currently focusing on backend architecture, containerized environments, and scalable web app design.

Always learning, always improving â€” currently exploring system design and modern backend patterns.

Iâ€™m happy to help, letâ€™s connect and build something great together. <br />
